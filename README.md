# Conways-Game-Of-Life


### Rules for Conway's Game of Life

1. Cells that are alive must have 2-3 neighbors to stay alive

2. Cells that have less than 2 neighbors dies

3. Cells with more than 3 neighbors dies


1 = live cell

0 = dead cell

For this project a Generation counter is required, as well as a way to go foward and backwards
